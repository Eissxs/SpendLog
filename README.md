🧪 Project Goals

This prototype demonstrates:
	•	Building a clean, mobile-first expense tracker UI in SwiftUI
	•	Using UserDefaults to store and reset daily expense data
	•	Displaying multiple chart types using Swift Charts
	•	Animating a splash screen with logo scaling and modern loaders
	•	Scheduling notifications with UserNotifications
	•	Applying MVVM where appropriate

⸻

📦 Installation
	1.	Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/spendlog.git


  2.	Open SpendLog.xcodeproj in Xcode
	3.	Run the app on a simulator or device (iOS 16+ recommended)

⚠️ What Could Improve (for Production Readiness)

📁 File Organization
	•	While ViewModels and folders exist, some logic could be further modularized.
	•	Use a Models/, ViewModels/, and Resources/ structure consistently.
	•	Consider centralizing color and font styles in Assets or a Theme.swift.

💾 State Management
	•	Relies on @StateObject and UserDefaults directly.
	•	For scalability, Core Data or @ObservableObject services would be more robust.
	•	Dependency injection or a shared data layer would improve testability.

🧪 Testing & Edge Cases
	•	Currently, no error handling or input validation beyond simple formatting.
	•	Implement validation for negative or extremely high amounts.
	•	Add unit tests for ViewModel calculations (totals, filters).

🌐 Localization & Strings
	•	Most strings are hardcoded. Use a constants file or Localizable.strings.

🔔 Daily Reminder Setup

The app will prompt users once per day to log their spending.
You must allow notifications when the app first launches.
No backend is used — all logic runs locally via UNUserNotificationCenter.
